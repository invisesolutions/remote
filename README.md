**Remote Support Repo for Invise Solutions**
Contents: Scripts, tools, and binaries used during remote control sessions. Code for scripts are often published here for transparency, anyone can investigate what we use to setup remote control sessions and automate many of the tasks we perform during initial computer troubleshooting by our helpdesk technicians.
